These are the sample questions for the code challenge I have on tuesday. 

Your weekend challenge from me:
make a new folder, and create a file named bird.rb
create a Bird class
add a binding.pry to the very bottom of the file
make sure birds can be created with a name and a breed
make sure you can read the breed of a bird, and you can read or change the name of the bird after it's created
make sure you have a method that can tell us all the birds that have been created
make 3 birds after the class and before the binding.pry
run your bird.rb file, make sure you can hit your binding.pry, so you can:
read the breed of one of the birds
read the name of one of the birds
change the name of one of the birds
make a new bird and make sure it gets added to your list of all the birds
make a class method in your code that returns all birds that are a certain breed (aka a class method called all_robins that returns a list of all the birds that are of breed 'robin')
make an instance method called shout that returns the birds name in all caps and with an exclamation point (e.g. if the bird's name is Blueberry, it returns 'BLUEBERRY!')
